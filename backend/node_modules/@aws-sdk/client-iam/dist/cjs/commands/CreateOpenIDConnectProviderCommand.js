/**
 * <p>Creates an IAM entity to describe an identity provider (IdP) that supports <a href="http://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect (OIDC)</a>.</p>
 *         <p>The OIDC provider that you create with this operation can be used as a principal in a
 *             role's trust policy. Such a policy establishes a trust relationship between Amazon Web Services and
 *             the OIDC provider.</p>
 *         <p>If you are using an OIDC identity provider from Google, Facebook, or Amazon Cognito, you don't
 *             need to create a separate IAM identity provider. These OIDC identity providers are
 *             already built-in to Amazon Web Services and are available for your use. Instead, you can move directly
 *             to creating new roles using your identity provider. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html">Creating
 *                 a role for web identity or OpenID connect federation</a> in the <i>IAM
 *                 User Guide</i>.</p>
 *         <p>When you create the IAM OIDC provider, you specify the following:</p>
 *         <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>The URL of the OIDC identity provider (IdP) to trust</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>A list of client IDs (also known as audiences) that identify the application
 *                     or applications  allowed to authenticate using the OIDC provider</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>A list of thumbprints of one or more server certificates that the IdP
 *                     uses</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *         <p>You get all of this information from the OIDC IdP that you want to use to access
 *             Amazon Web Services.</p>
 *         <note>
 *             <p>Amazon Web Services secures communication with some OIDC identity providers (IdPs) through our
 *             library of trusted certificate authorities (CAs) instead of using a certificate
 *             thumbprint to verify your IdP server certificate. These OIDC IdPs include Google, and
 *             those that use an Amazon S3 bucket to host a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint. In these
 *             cases, your legacy thumbprint remains in your configuration, but is no longer used for validation.</p>
 *          </note>
 *         <note>
 *             <p>The trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the IAM provider that this
 *                 operation creates. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the <a>CreateOpenIDConnectProvider</a> operation to highly privileged
 *                 users.</p>
 *         </note>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { IAMClient, CreateOpenIDConnectProviderCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-iam"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { IAMClient, CreateOpenIDConnectProviderCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-iam"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new IAMClient(config);
 * const command = new CreateOpenIDConnectProviderCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link CreateOpenIDConnectProviderCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link CreateOpenIDConnectProviderCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link IAMClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
